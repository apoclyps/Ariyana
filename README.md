Ariyana
================================
Description : Developed in XNA for PC using a MVC structure and design patterns.
The Big Idea/Concept

Ariyana is a noir style world inspired by the two opposing sides in chess whilst incorporating elements of tower defence and real time strategy elements to provide a unique twist on a traditional game. The boundaries between black and white blur drastically when good must verse evil in the ultimate showdown where only one side can claim victory of the war and rule the land!
Play Mechanic

Players create and manage a grid type battlefield with a variety of unit types and resources in real time. Enemies attack periodically in waves and waves increase in size over time throughout three phases. The player gathers resources during the game to summon additional units to the field. A spell book grants access to special abilities and allows the mechanics of the game to fit in with the story.
Game Summary

As the last line of defence, the inhabitants of a peaceful realm take a stand when Oroan, a demon lord threatens all life in the kingdom! Gathering armour, weapons, and even prayers holy soldiers are summoned to defend the last human stronghold against an unrelenting destructive wave of demons.
